This repository contains some examples of many RF related projects that I have worked on. Some of these might be in active development.

Most of the work here serves as a reference for my active involvement with Queen's Space Engineering Team, where I currently lead the RF design of a Cubesat's transceiver.

For the most part, I will be posting some hardware projects (such as antenna designs, simulation results, etc.), although one might occasionally find some software related topics, especially for signal processing (GNU Radio).
